gm Cerv,

I’ll always be grateful for your support in helping me get started to contributing to Optimism and the RetroFunding algorithms. As I continue to grow my skills, your guidance and the quality of work at OSO have been both inspiring and aspirational for me.

I’m now at a stage where joining a forward-thinking team like OSO is more than just a career goal—it’s a way for me to contribute meaningfully to solving real business problems and building long-term value for projects.

With my additional background in research and data storytelling, I’d also be happy to help communicate our insights—whether through dashboards, reports, or client-facing narratives that clearly show the “why” behind the numbers.

I’d deeply appreciate the opportunity to contribute to your team—even if it means starting small. Please let me know if there’s a way I can get involved.

Thanks again for everything,
ChristianLet's make Superchain data flow.
